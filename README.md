# i2c under Linux

This is a library to use the I2C bus on the Raspberry Pi in Go.

## Disclaimer

I develop this library for myself and just for fun in my free time. If you find it useful, I'm happy to hear about that. If you have trouble using it, you have all the source code to fix the problem yourself (although pull requests are welcome).
